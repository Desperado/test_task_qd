# API Test task
## Overview 

Second part of Test Automation Assignment

API TEST AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK based on `mocha.js` and `chai-promises` and is used against reqres.in

## Introduction

[Mocha.js](https://mochajs.org/) Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.
Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.
That's why it is an easy and good choice for any kind of API Test Automation purpose.

## System requirements

- MacOS 10.x-12.x
- Node.js 14
- MacOS commandline tools
- VS Code for opening the project
