# API Test task
## Overview 

Second part of Test Automation Assignment

API TEST AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK based on `mocha.js` and `chai-promises` and is used against reqres.in

## Introduction

[Mocha.js](https://mochajs.org/) Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.
Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.
That's why it is an easy and good choice for any kind of API Test Automation purpose.

## System requirements

- MacOS 10.x-12.x
- Node.js 14
- MacOS commandline tools
- VS Code for opening the project

### Github Status

| CI            | Build Status  |

### How to run after check out

```bash 
cd api
npm install

```

### How to get reporting

## Observation

I have made a few more tests, also including tests for `users` endpoints, to get users list and also to create users, also `register-users.test.js` have tests using hardcoded data and data that it gets from the previous requests

## Possible enhancements

A few things can be done more.
- Function around get one user data
- I was looking to additionally automatically post status reports to github.io page but hasn't resolved the publish step
