# UI Test task
## Overview 

This is example Cypress scenario to do the tests against the simple login form

## Introduction

[Cypress.io](https://cypress.io) is a very popular test framework for testing complex rich-UI applications, has a rich documentation and support, instantly supports Chrome and Electron and also recently has started to support Firefox. No wonder that I have chosen this framework for this task. I think it is easy and approachable, and also its syntaxis is very simple

## System requirements

- MacOS 10.x-12.x
- Node.js 14
- MacOS command line tools
- VS Code for opening the project

## Installation

After you have cloned the repository locally please use this command to install the framework and dependencies. The framework explicitly uses new version of Cypress - `cypress@10.3.0` 
  
	cd ui
	npm install

After that you can run Cypress in without UI with
    
	npm run -s cypress:run -- --env username=tomsmith,password=SuperSecretPassword! --spec cypress/e2e/sign-in.cy.js

## The solution

uses plain BDD spec with standard Cypress stylistic, Cucumber could be used as well but I left it out for the sake of simplicity here.

## Github Status

All the code is executed automatically and it is possible to view the result in the github directly

| CI            | Build Status  |

## Improvements

### Improvement #1

- Put passwords and usernames out of the repository code and instead inject them as secure variables in the github project or use other means of security abstraction

### Improvement #2

- Wrap assertions into the specific module and functions and so have those UI elements out of the test files.

### Improvement #3

- Make a reporting nicer with html reports
